# Quick setup for mac

Installs all the things I normally use plus sets up terminal, zsh config etc - a basic attempt to make it easier to set up a new mac.

run `setup.sh` to get started.


## What this doesn't do
### VSCode
Sign in with github and sync settings.

### 1Password git ssh signing
See [docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/git-commit-signing) - it's easier to go into the app, select the key you want to use and let it automatically set it up for you.
